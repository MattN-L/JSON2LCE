JSON2LCE AKA MNL'S Super Simple Skin Converter!
-----------------------------------------------
A very simple tool used to convert Minecraft: Bedrock Skin and Entity JSON files to the Legacy Console Edition Skin format. This tool will automatically convert bone names, such as "left_arm" to "ARM0", and will automatically flip the boxes' Y values, instead of manually. It will even accept both legacy AND new Bedrock Entity JSON formats. (:

I made this in 2 days, lol. The goal was to help streamline the process of converting these models. It seems like every converter has some sort of problem, so hopefully I help can prevent a few more headaches!

**Usage**
1. Click the button
2. Follow the instructions
3. You're done. It's that simple.

TODO
----
- Add Support and detection for ANIM, or at least partially
- Add Support and detection for custom offsets
- Add Support for PSM files (Custom [PCK Studio](https://github.com/PhoenixARC/-PCK-Studio) Skin Model format)
- Add Support for CSM and PSM to JSON
- Maybe direct Blockbench support?
