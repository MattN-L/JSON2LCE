JSON2LCE AKA MNL'S Super Simple Skin Converter!
-----------------------------------------------
A very simple tool used to convert Minecraft: Bedrock Skin and Entity JSON files to the Legacy Console Edition Skin format. This tool will automatically convert bone names, such as "left_arm" to "ARM0", and will automatically flip the boxes' Y values, instead of manually. It will even accept both legacy AND new Bedrock Entity JSON formats. (:

I made this in 2 days, lol.

**Usage**
1. Click the button
2. Follow the instructions
3. You're done. It's that simple.

TODO
----
- Add Support and detection for ANIM, or at least partially
- Add Support and detection for custom offsets

**Special Thanks**
